# ArcaneBlast Spam
World of Warcraft 3.3.5 AddOn to optimize Arcane Mage DPS

The AddOn simulates a spam of Arcane Blast - i.e. no cast of Arcane Missiles, including use of cooldowns, and gives a time estimate on how long you can keep up without running out of mana.
	
This is useful in combination with a TimeToDie AddOn/WeakAura to know when you can stop casting Arcane Missiles, in order to optimise your mana usage near the end of a boss fight.

### Version 0.2 To do list

* Implement haste rating bonuses from gear/items: Potion of Speed, Hyperspeed Accelerators, Trinkets (anything else?)

* Reset texts on combat end

* Use SavedVariables to store frame position, instead of relying on SetUserPlaced

* Add customisation options (e.g. background/text colour, font type and size)
